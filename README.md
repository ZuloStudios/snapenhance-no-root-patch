# SnapEnhance LSPatch
SnapEnhance is an Xposed mod that enhances your Snapchat experience.

This ***unofficial*** repository uses a GitHub Actions workflow for generating a Snapchat APK by using the [SnapEnhance Module](https://github.com/rhunk/SnapEnhance) and creating a public release.

## How the Github Action works:

This GitHub Actions workflow automates the creation of a Snapchat Patch for Non-Root users. Here's how it works:

1. **Snapchat Download**: The action downloads the latest stable version of Snapchat from APKMirror.

2. **SnapEnhance Download**: It also fetches the latest version of SnapEnhance from the original repository.

3. **Patch Build**: The action then builds the patch version of Snapchat.

4. **Upload to Release**: Finally, it uploads the patch to a new GitHub Release with the first 3 parts of the version matching the SnapEnhance version.
